# SOCKS5 Proxy Server Requirements

This document outlines the requirements for a high-performance SOCKS5 proxy server.

### Functional Requirements:
1.  **SOCKS5 Protocol Compliance:**
    *   The server must implement the SOCKS5 protocol as specified in RFC 1928.
    *   It must support the `CONNECT` command for TCP streaming.
    *   It must handle the following address types: IPv4, IPv6, and domain names.
2.  **Authentication:**
    *   The server will only support the "No Authentication Required" method (method code 0x00).
3.  **Proxying:**
    *   The server will relay TCP traffic between the client and the destination server.
4.  **Configuration:**
    *   The listening IP address and port for the proxy server will be configurable via a JSON file (e.g., `appsettings.json`).
    *   The application can be launched with a command-line argument specifying the path to the configuration file.
    *   If no argument is provided, it will look for a default configuration file in the application's directory.
5.  **Graceful Shutdown:**
    *   The application will handle the `Ctrl+C` signal to shut down gracefully, ensuring that all active connections are terminated properly and resources are released.

### Non-Functional Requirements:
1.  **Performance:**
    *   The server must be high-performance, capable of handling a large number of concurrent connections with low latency.
    *   It will use asynchronous I/O operations (`async`/`await`) to avoid blocking threads and maximize scalability.
    *   It will leverage .NET Channels or Pipelines to efficiently manage data streams, minimizing memory allocations and maintaining a low memory footprint.
2.  **Platform:**
    *   The application will be a console program built on .NET 9.
    *   The programming language will be C#.
3.  **Logging:**
    *   The server will provide structured logging for key events, such as:
        *   Server start and stop.
        *   Client connections initiated and terminated.
        *   Destination connections established.
        *   Errors and exceptions.
4.  **Error Handling:**
    *   The server must handle network errors (e.g., connection refused, host unreachable) and protocol violations gracefully, sending appropriate SOCKS5 reply codes to the client.
5.  **Code Quality:**
    *   The code should be well-structured, modular, and easy to maintain.
